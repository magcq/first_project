# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project is about using AI to improve the quality of  communication documents produced for work-projects. 


## Background

Any work-project has a set of goals, objectives and will involve some principle topics. I want to a tool that can analyse a document and assess its relevance to a given work-project in my organisation. For example one work-project is about improving innovation policies for Industry 4.0 uptake by small businesses.

How to characterise the work-project is the first challenge!
* manually create a list of the words that would likely appear in relevant documents for the project?
* or analyse a set of documents that are deemed relevant for the project to build the frequency of words used- also do this for documents that are of no relevance?
* Or other approach?


## How is it used?

The solution would be adopted in my organisation which has multiple work-projects and a wide network of stakeholders to whom information is circulated at regular intervals. Each time a project leader creates a news item for the work-project, the tool would be used to assess the relevancy of the news item for that work-project. The tool could be integrated into a project management platform that we use to publish project communications online.

```
def main():
   #no code to propse as yet...

   # write your solution here


main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
The training data would come from pdf files or web pages provided by the project manager. The document to be rated for relevancy could be a pdf or url to an article from a third party or could also be created by the project manager.


## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? 
Soem thought needs to be given to the dynamic nature of the words that are used to describe subjects - new terms emerge. How can that be addressed to esnure that emerging terminology is included in the relvance assessment.

## What next?
This could grow by use of the AI tool along with a web search to find the most relevant information sources for a work-project.
